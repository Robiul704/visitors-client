<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">How to choose the best blogging platform</h1>
While all platforms slightly vary in terms of features, the best blogging platforms should cover all core features including an easy-to-use content editor, tons of themes and templates, some search engine optimization SEO tools (or an ability to install third-party ones), and an ample app store with extensions or integrations with third-party tools. 

In addition to this,your should look for advanced security, analytics and performance tracking tools, a solid customer service, ecommerce features (if you plan to monetize your blog), and a free trial (or at least a money-back guarantee) – so you can try out the platform before spending any money. 

Also,before opting for one blogging platform over the others, you should have an idea of how much creative freedom and control you wish to have over your blog – as well as what level of technical know-how you possess.

<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">What is a blogging platform?</h1>
Not long ago, the tools you would use to create a site and tools for building a blog were quite different – now, the boundary that divided them is blurred more than ever. Most content management systems (CMS’) and full-fledged website builders will allow you to create and manage any sort of blog or a site. 

So, nowadays, a blogging platform refers to any software-based set of tools that let you create a blog while storing all your content, media, files, links, and everything else critical for your blog to work.
